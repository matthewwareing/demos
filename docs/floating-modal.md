## What's This About?

This component provides a floating modal interface that overlays the main content of your app. The modal uses a semi-transparent background to create depth and focus on the modal content while maintaining context of the underlying screen. It handles its own state management and visibility transitions, making it easy to integrate into any screen.

## Technical Implementation

The component uses:

- Reanimated for animations
- Background opacity control
- Modal state management
- Layout positioning
- Touch handling

## Usage

```tsx
// Basic usage<FloatingModal />
```
