## What's This About?

This component creates an interactive drawing interface that transforms user-drawn paths into Fourier series representations. When a user draws a path, the component analyzes it and recreates the drawing using a series of rotating vectors, creating a mesmerizing visualization of the mathematical principles behind Fourier transforms. The drawing can be cleared and redrawn, with each recreation showing the path being formed through the circular motion of the transform.

## Technical Implementation

The component uses:

- Skia for path rendering
- Gesture handling
- SVG path conversion
- Reanimated for animations
- Ref-based control

## Usage

```tsx
// Basic usage<FourierVisualizer />
```
