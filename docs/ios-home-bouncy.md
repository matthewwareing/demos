## What's This About?

This project demonstrates how to create physics-based spring animations that make interfaces feel responsive. The animations are fully customizable, allowing you to understand how different parameters affect the feel of the motion.

## Features

The main screen displays a grid of colorful app icons that animate with a spring effect. Each icon scales from the center of the screen - the further from the center, the more dramatic the effect.

### Spring Customizer

Long press anywhere on the screen to open a modal where you can adjust the spring physics:

- Mass: Controls how "heavy" the animation feels
- Damping: Determines how quickly it settles
- Stiffness: Affects how snappy and responsive it is

The customizer has two modes:

- Opening: Adjust how the icons expand outward
- Closing: Fine-tune how they bounce back

### Play with the sliders

- Pull down on the customizer to dismiss it
- Tap anywhere to trigger the animation
- Watch values update in real-time as you drag the sliders

## Why this matters?

It doesn't, but it's so much fun 😅

I think it really helps to understand how spring animations work and how to customize them. In addition to that you can very easily reuse the BouncyView in your own projects.

Good animations make interfaces feel natural and responsive. When elements react with realistic physics, it creates a tangible connection between user and interface.
