## What's This About?

This component creates an interactive glass-like interface that responds to touch gestures and theme changes. The component features a draggable circle that creates a fractal glass effect as it moves, with dynamic color transitions between light and dark themes. The glass effect is achieved through a combination of blur effects and masks, creating a visually striking and modern UI element.

## Technical Implementation

The component uses:

- Skia for glass effects
- Gesture handling
- Theme switching
- Reanimated animations
- Mask compositing

## Usage

```tsx
// Basic usage<FractalGlass />;
// Component configurationconst CircleRadius = 100;const height = 300;const gradientsAmount = 4;
// Theme typestype Theme = 'light' | 'dark';
```
